Oclgrind 14.5
=============
Initial release (beta).

Implements a SPIR 1.2 interpreter which can be targeted either via an
OpenCL 1.2 runtime API implementation or using a standalone kernel
interface.

Provides the following utilities:
- Memory access error detection
- Work-group divergence detection (barriers, async-copies)
- Data-race detection (--data-races)
- Simple interactive debugger (--interactive)
- Instruction histograms (--inst-counts)
- OpenCL runtime API error reporting (--check-api)
